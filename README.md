# expenses

fixed:
  - used provider for global state management
  - implemented simplified UI
  - cleared up some bugs
  - swapped out sqlite db for JSON
issues:
  - json layer is flaky -> issues with working
  - poor separation of concerns wrt account and provider
  - chrome build and android build are different
